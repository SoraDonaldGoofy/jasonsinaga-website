            <h4>Segway</h4>
                <h5>In a group of 3 and under the guidance of <a href="https://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ece/Faculty/Hoffman_Eric/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Professor Eric Hoffman</a>, we developed a Segway. He instructed us in SystemVerilog and guided us in synthesis with Synopsys. 
                We utilized Quartus to map it to a DE0-Nano. We developed modules for SPI, UART, Piezo, Integrator, A2D interface, and other minor components. Additionally, we tested these modules in ModelSim and ensured
                that they met timing and size requirements.</h5>

The instructions
            supported include arithmetic operations, memory instructions, and branches. We developed modules for the ALU, Forwarding Control, Register File, Pipeline Registers, and Control units. Testbenches were made for smaller modules and register values were traced from the testbench.</h5>

                <h4>UW Student Database</h4>
                <h5>In a group of 4, we implemented an application that allows users to access a database of students 
                    with a Red Black Binary Tree implementation. The application allowed for importing, adding, removing, and
                    searching UW Madison students based on their ID number. The data assocciated with each student are their
                 names, majors, and years.</h5>
        
                <h4>Reddit Post Search Engine</h4>
                <h5>In a group of 4, we implemented a search engine for Reddit posts by using a hashtable. 
                    We used Linear Probing and Linked Lists for collision handling when storing posts 
                    based on their words in their titles and body. Users can search for these posts by typing in
                    the relevant key words. Users can also import reddit posts to store into the search engine.</h5>
        
                <h4>Subway Navigator App</h4>
                <h5>Implemented an app with JavaFX that implemented Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path 
                between two subway stations on Linux. Users can write down the starting point of their journey and their end point.
                They will receive information on the stations they would need to pass by and also the associated cost.
                Furthermore, users can also receive the map's Prim's Algorithm representation.</h5>

                <h5>Notable skills: Git, Red Black Tree, Hashtables, Djikstra's Algorithm, Linux, Makefile</h5>

                <h4>Key Hunter</h4>
                <h5>Created a game with Tim R. Wang called Key Hunter. Used an MSP432P401R Launchpad and Development Kit that employed the joystick, buttons, 
                accelerometer, light sensor, speaker, and LCD Display. The goal of the game is for the player to acquire all keys in each level. More levels will be unlocked as 
                more levels are completed by the player. However, they need to avoid protruding spikes and patrolling enemies that can hurt the player.</h5>
                <h4>Heap Allocator</h4>
                <h5>Created a program that simulated memory allocation following the IA-32 architecture. Header and Footer blocks were incorporated and immediate splitting
                    was done during memory allocation. Memory block coalescing was user-initiated.
                </h5>

            <h4>Cashier App</h4>
            <h5>Created a GUI-based application that acts as an advanced cash register that uses the libraries openpyxl, xlsxwriter, and customtkinter. The app reads an excel file that 
                loads the inventory. From the app, the user can add items, put items in the shopping cart and sell them, and generate a new excel report with the new inventory count. You 
                can look at it <a href="https://github.com/SoraDonaldGoofy/Advanced-Cash-Register/tree/GUI"

            <h4>Quantum Password Generator</h4>
            <h5>Participated in the Wisconsin Quantum Computing Club Quantum Hackathon. Utilized Qiskit to complete several notebooks on
            quantum circuits and made a <a href="https://github.com/SoraDonaldGoofy/Quantum_Password_Generator">Random Password Generator</a> using a quantum circuit with multiple Hadamard gates.

            <h4>Intro to LaTeX handout</h4>
                <h5>Created a handout that teaches beginners important notes about LaTeX for making mathematical documents (particularly for discrete
                     math courses). A target file is also provided to practice using LaTeX with the goal of replicating it.

            <h5>Created a program that calculates the capacitance of parallel, different sized discs. Different surface charge denisity values
                were provided in multiple radii intervals. The total charge and electric potential were calculated via integration by constant addition.

            <h3>PCB Design and Assembly</h3>
            <h4>Altium & Assembly</h4>
                <h5>Designed a PCB together with its schematics. Connected the ports through orthogonal routing. PCB was then printed and then assembled the PCB with all its components. 
                    The components included the MCU, capacitors, resistors, LEDs, switches, and MOSFETs. The PCB is programmed for players to attempt to press the button when the green LEDs are on.
                    If successful, the player will continue to the next round but the LEDs will light up faster.
