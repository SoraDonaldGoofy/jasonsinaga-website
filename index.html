                We utilized Quartus to map it to a DE0-Nano. We developed modules for SPI, UART, Piezo, Integrator, A2D interface, and other minor components. Additionally, we tested these modules in ModelSim and ensured
                that they met timing and size requirements.</h5>

The instructions
            supported include arithmetic operations, memory instructions, and branches. We developed modules for the ALU, Forwarding Control, Register File, Pipeline Registers, and Control units. Testbenches were made for smaller modules and register values were traced from the testbench.</h5>

                    We used Linear Probing and Linked Lists for collision handling when storing posts 
                    based on their words in their titles and body. Users can search for these posts by typing in
                    the relevant key words. Users can also import reddit posts to store into the search engine.</h5>

                <h5>Implemented an app with JavaFX that implemented Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path 
                between two subway stations on Linux. Users can write down the starting point of their journey and their end point.
                They will receive information on the stations they would need to pass by and also the associated cost.
                Furthermore, users can also receive the map's Prim's Algorithm representation.</h5>

                accelerometer, light sensor, speaker, and LCD Display. The goal of the game is for the player to acquire all keys in each level. More levels will be unlocked as 
                more levels are completed by the player. However, they need to avoid protruding spikes and patrolling enemies that can hurt the player.</h5>
